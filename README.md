# Sum of previous
Implement [com.epam.rd.autotasks.arrays.SumOfPrevious](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/arrays/SumOfPrevious.java) method:
<br><b>getSumCheckArray(int[] array)</b> - returns an array of booleans where each element is a result of a check if a corresponding element is a sum of two previous elements in given array.

- Method takes an array of integers as a parameter.
- The length of given array is guaranteed to be 2 or more.
- Given array is guaranteed not to be null.
- Method returns an array of booleans where each element is a result for corresponding element in given array.
- First two elements of the boolean array are always false.

Class [com.epam.rd.autotasks.arrays.SumOfPrevious](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/arrays/SumOfPrevious.java)
 contains <b>public static void main(String[] args)</b>. 
 <br>An array is created there, and a result of the getSumCheckArray method called for it is printed in the console.
 <br>Size and values of the array can be changed for testing of the solution.
